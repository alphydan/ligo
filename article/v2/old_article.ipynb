This discussion will necessarily ommit\nmost of the details.  Our intention is to give a flavour of the type of Physics\nwhich describe gravitational waves.  \n\nA full treatment would require laying a deep foundation which involves\ncalculus, differential equations, algebra, tensors, modern mechanics and \nEinstein's relativity. Instead we will try to use math and concepts \navailable to a curious and motivated high school student. \n\nThe most difficult concept to grasp is what these waves are _made of_.\nOr the related question, if water goes up & down in a water wave, \nwhat goes up and down in a gravitational wave? Before we get there,\nwe will quickly review some math & notation about waves in general.\n\n### The wave equation\n\n<img alt=\"simple wave definitions\" src=\"./img/wave_nomenclature.png\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 45%;\" />\n\n\nA common equation we learn in high school is $v = \\lambda \\times f$, \nwhere the velocity of the wave $v$ is equal to the wavelength $\\lambda$ times the frequency $f$.  \nThis assumes the wave is monocromatic (only one wavelength, or only one frequency), and always\ntravels at the same speed.  However, that equation says nothing about where the wave is, \nhow high it is or in which direction it's moving.  For that we need differential equations.\nIf you have learnt how to find a derivative (often written $f'$ or $\\frac{df}{dx}$) \nyou can understand differential equations.\n\n#### Differential Equations\n\n\nAll Physical laws so far can be written down as equations which combine a variable \n(time, displacement, electric field, temperature, etc ) and one or more derivatives of that variable.\nSuch an equation is called a _differential equation_.  For example:\n\n$$ F = -kx $$\n\nThat equation describes the force on a spring.  It says, \nthe more you stretch the spring (so, $x$ gets bigger ),\nthe bigger the force $F$ becomes (pointing in the opposite direction of the stretching).\n\nBut, as Newton postulated, $F = ma$.  But, $a = \\frac{\\Delta v}{\\Delta t}$.  \n(reminder: $\\Delta x$ means, difference between final and initial x, \nthat's why they are **differen**tial equations).\nWhen $\\Delta v$ is a tiny difference, we write $\\frac{dv}{dt}$.  Or said otherwise, \nthe acceleration is the derivative of the velocity with respect to time.\nNow, to save some ink (pixels?) and make equations easier to read, physicists \nhave a special notation.  **The dot notation**.  A dot above a variable means take a time derivative.\nSo, $\\frac{dv}{dt} = \\dot{v}$.\n\nSo back to our differential equation.  The force from a spring is $F = -kx$.\nbut $F = ma = m\\dot{v}$.  And in fact, $v = \\frac{dx}{dt}$.  Since the velocity\nis the derivative of the displacement, we can say: $a = \\dot{v} = \\ddot{x}$.\nPutting all this back into our spring equation we have:\n\n$$ \\ddot{x} = -\\frac{k}{m} x $$\n\nIn plain English: \n\n> Can you find a function $x(t)$ that when you take the \nderivative twice you get the same function but with a \n$-\\frac{k}{m}$ in front?\n\nMost of Physics can be cast to this process:  \n\n1. Write down the force\n2. Put it into Newton's equation\n3. You will get a riddle about derivatives\n4. Solve the riddle $\\Rightarrow$ get the answer! \n\n\nLet's solve our riddle!  You could try $t^2$, $e^{t^3}$, $3t^k$, \nand see if it works.  However, if you are an expert at derivatives\nyou know a function which comes back to itself with a minus after two derivatives:\n$$cos(t) \\rightarrow -sin(t) \\rightarrow -cos(t)$$\n\nwith an extra trick, we can make it work:\n\n$$cos( \\omega t) \\rightarrow -\\omega sin(\\omega t) \\rightarrow -\\omega^2 cos(\\omega t)$$\n\nwhere we write $\\omega$ instead of the cumbersome $\\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$.\n\nNow we know that a mass at the end of a spring (without friction) will move a distance\naway from equilibrium $x(t) = cos(\\omega t)$, tracing the shape of a cosine function. \n\n\n####\n\n","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00001-7b10854d-179c-47b1-a6d2-1b57e1868c76","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Wave equations (Water, Ropes, Light)\n\nA similar thing can be done for ropes or water.

I encourage you to see what happens when\n$t$ increases in that equation.

If the substance or object, can move\nleft-right ($x$), up-down ($y$) and back-forth ($z$), the equation becomes:\n\n$$ \\ddot{A} = c^2 \\; \\left(A_{xx} + A_{yy} + A_{zz}\\right) $$\n\nInstead of $y(x,t)$, I've used $A(x,y,z,t)$ for the amplitude or displacement of the wave.  \nIt could be the electric field, the height of a wave, or something else that vibrates.\n\nIn any case, it's getting a bit boring to write out that many symbols!\nPhysicists are a lazy bunch, so here's another notation trick.\nYou may have noticed that the $A$ is on all terms of the equation.  Physicists sometimes like to think\nof derivatives as operations you apply to something. You could write the wave equation as:\n\n$$ \\left[\\ddot{\\square} - c^2 \\; \\left(\\square_{xx} + \\square_{yy} + \\square_{zz}\\right)\\right] A = 0 $$\n\nSaying something like:  Put the $A$ in each one of those boxes, do all the operations, and you'll get zero.\nOr, take the time derivative twice, \nsubtract double derivatives in x,y,z with a factor of $c^2$ and you should get zero.\n\nBut as I said, physicists are lazy, so they usually shorten the whole wave equation to:\n\n$$ \\square \\; A = 0 $$\n\nThat little square which hides 8 derivatives under the hood is called the [D'Alambertian](https://encyclopediaofmath.org/wiki/D%27Alembert_operator).\nIt may not come as a surprise that the equation for gravitational waves is simply:\n\n $$\\square \\; g_{\\mu\\nu} = 0$$\n\nBut what in the world is $$g_{\\mu\\nu}$$?","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00002-de6698fd-d896-48a4-b6e6-c6d3aca78519","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00003-d5201f2c-da92-42e2-8fea-43a211aa8d72","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Einstein's Relativity\n\nEinstein articulated two groundbreaking theories last century.\nSpecial relativity in 2005 and General Relativity in 2015.\n\n### Special Relativity\n\nSpecial relativity describes everything that Newton described, \nplus what happens when objects travel close to the speed of light.\nHis goal was to marry two requirements:\n\n- Obey the equations of electromagnetism (which describe light, electricity and magnetism)\n- That the laws of physics should look the same (be absolute!) for anyone in the universe.\n\nThose seemingly innocent requirements opened pandora's box.  Light is an electric\nfield (E) and a magnetic field (B).

Equally if you try to catch a beam of light and \nrun behind it at 298,000 km/s, it should still run away from you at 300,000 km/s.  \n\nReconciling these seemingly contradictory ideas gave birth to special relativity.\nUnderstading the consequences is beyond our scope, but it introduced a critical question:\n\n> **How do we measure time, distance and velocity?**\n\nThe theory of general relativity has some counter-intuitive answers to that question.\n\n\n","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00003-5262bded-76cd-4801-9468-44a46308e709","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### A theory of metrics\n\nTo develop an intuition about general relativity, \nwe need to remind ourselves how we measure distances.\nLet's start with pythagoras.\n\n<img alt=\"string equation\" src=\"./img/pythagoras3d.png\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 35%;\" />\n\nto find a distance $d$ in 3D, we can do: $d^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2$.  \nEqually, we can find a distance in cartesian coordinates as $s^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$. \n\nThis way of measuring distances, however, is a convention.  \nLet's say our axes look like this:\n\n<img alt=\"axes 3x on y\" src=\"./img/axes.png\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 35%;\" />\n\nand 1 step in the $x$ direction is as long as 3 steps in the $y$ direction.\nWe can imagine that moving $\\sqrt{2}$ meters away from the origin $(0,0,0)$ \nin the direction of the red line, is described by this distance:\n\n$s^2 = x^2 +  \\frac{1}{3^2} y^2 + z^2$\n\nSo if we move 1 unit in $x$, 3 units in $y$ and zero units in $z$ we travel a distance:\n\n$s = \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{3^2}{3^2}} = \\sqrt{2}$\n\nThis rule for finding distances is called **[a metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_(mathematics) )**.

In 1908 Minkowski announced to fellow mathematicians:\n> \\[...\\] space by itself, and time by itself, \nare doomed to fade away into mere shadows, \nand only a kind of union of the two will preserve an independent reality\n\nThe metric above, in fact, is not just for distances between locations.\nIt finds the distance between **events**. \n\nThe word **event** in Physics has a very specific meaning.  It means a point in spacetime.\nAn event has 4 coordinates. Let's write it as $(t, x, y, z)$.\nIf you are standing in your chair at location (2,0,0) \nat time $t=0$, that is event $(0,2,0,0)$.  \nEven if you don't move, time goes by ... \nand a second later, you have \ntravelled one second into the future.  \nYour new coordinates are $(1,2,0,0 )$.\nIn the next second you travel 1m in the $x$-direction and land at $(2,3,0,0)$:\n3 meters away from $x=0$, and 2 seconds away from $t=0$.\n\nHow much did you travel in spacetime?  Minkowski says:\n\n$$s = \\sqrt{(2c)^2 - 1^2}$$\n\nYou can imagine this as a very, very, very thin pizza.  In the time direction\nwe travelled 2$\\times$ 300,000km and in the x-direction we travelled $1$m.\nOnly light can create non-thin pizzas.  In a second, it can move 300,000km \nin the time direction and 300,000km in the $x$-direction, making a nice isosceles triangle.\n\n#### Notation for metrics:\n\nOk, before we move to General relativity we are going to change our notation for metrics.\nPythagoras for a tiny tiny distance $ds$ can be re-written as:\n\n$$ ds^2 = dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2  $$\n$$ \n= \\left(\\begin{matrix} dx & dy & dz  \\end{matrix} \\right)\n\\left(\\begin{matrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\  0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1  \\end{matrix} \\right)\n\\left(\\begin{matrix} dx \\\\ dy \\\\ dz  \\end{matrix} \\right)\n$$\n\nThis may seem pretty useless, but this helps us see more clearly the \nfactors in front of the $dx, dy, dz$. The matrix in the middle is what we are interested in.\nIn flat spacetime, this becomes\n\n$$ \nds^2 = \\left(\\begin{matrix} dt & dx & dy & dz  \\end{matrix} \\right)\n\\left(\\begin{matrix} c^2 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\  0 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & -1  \\end{matrix} \\right)\n\\left(\\begin{matrix} dt \\\\ dx \\\\ dy \\\\ dz  \\end{matrix} \\right)\n$$\n\nTo make our life easier we take c=1 (speed of light = 1).  \nTo do this all we have to do is make up some new units.  For example I hearby invent the Mitur.\n1 Mitur = 300,000,000 meters.  So c = 1 Mitur/s.  From now on, we'll use those units.\n\nNext, we'll use the same symbols for all coordinates.  So instead of writing\n$(cdt, dx, dy, dz)$ we will use $(x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3)$.   \nTo save pixels and typing, we shorten it like so:\n\n$$ x^\\alpha = (x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3)$$\nwhere $\\alpha$ is assumed to run from $0 \\rightarrow 3$. The vector can be transposed like so:\n\n$$ x_\\alpha = \\left( \\begin{matrix} x_0\\\\ x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3  \\end{matrix} \\right)$$\n\nAt last, we can define the metric in General Relativity.  \nMeasuring tiny displacements in spacetime is done like so:\n\n$$ \nds^2 = dx^\\alpha \\left(\\begin{matrix} g_{00} & g_{01} & g_{02} & g_{03} \\\\  \ng_{10} & g_{11} & g_{12} & g_{13} \\\\ \ng_{20} & g_{21} & g_{22} & g_{23} \\\\ \ng_{30} & g_{31} & g_{32} & g_{33} \\end{matrix} \\right)\ndx_\\alpha\n$$\n\nThe matrix in the middle is called **the metric** and tells us how to measure spacetime.\nIt is usually shortened as $$g_{\\mu\\nu}$$. Surprisingly, \nno matter which coordinates you chose, $ds^2$ is always the same number in\nrelativity.  The $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ elements in the matrix will grow and shrink accordingly \nto make the spacetime-displacement a conserved quantity under changes of coordinates.\n\n\n","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00006-08605a39-f6ba-430a-94e4-69d0f99d7d2e","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Einstein's GR Equation\n\nIf we ignore the expansion of the universe for a second, \nEinstein discovered the following equation after a decade of laboring:\n\n$$ \nG_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{8\\pi G}{c^4} T_{\\mu\\nu}  \n$$\n\nThis describes most of [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_field_equations).\n\n\nThe left side is about the shape of space and the metric, \n$$G_{\\mu\\nu} = R_{\\mu\\nu} - \\frac{1}{2}R g_{\\mu\\nu}$$. \n\nThe symbol $R$, called Ricci curvature tells us about the curvature of spacetime, \nthe $g$ tells us how to measure distances along $dx$, along $dt$, but also along weird\ncombinations like along $dx\\; dz$ or $dt\\; dy$. \n\n\nThe right side is about what is inside of that space (energy, mass, etc). \n![Stress Energy Tensor](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/StressEnergyTensor_contravariant.svg/320px-StressEnergyTensor_contravariant.svg.png)\n\nAll those $\\mu \\nu$ indexes let us know where we are on the matrix.\nFor example, $\\mu =0, \\nu=1$ stands for time and x-direction.\nIf we wrote out all the multiplications and indexes it would give\n**10 coupled,non-linear, second-order, hyperbolic-elliptic partial \ndifferential equations for the metric components $g_{\\mu\\nu}$**.\n\nIf that sounds scary,  it is.

Once the event had been located and  positioned approximately in the center of its section, we could apply a crop to isolate the chosen interval and discard the noisy data on either side.

To allow us to plot all of the events on the same X-axis, some points needed to be cut from the longest sections of interest. We used a method of **subsampling**  to achieve this.\nThe lowest number of data points in any one of the events was 1400. Graphs with higher numbers of points (up to ~5000) were downsampled.\n- code  <<-- `too detailed, we can link to a notebook at the end.`\n\n##### Step 5: Normalising Virgo events\n\nThe y-axis on these plots is called strain.  **Strain** is amount of deformation experienced by a body in the direction of force applied, divided by initial dimensions of the body.  Or:\n\n$$ \\mathrm{Strain} = \\frac{\\Delta L }{L} $$\n\nIn our case, it's the relative change in one arm of the LIGO intereferometer compared to the other.  Thus, strain is unitless.  Typical LIGO strains are in the range $10^{-19} - 20^{-23}$.   This means that if you had a $100$km metal rod ($10^5$m), you would need to measure differences in length which are $10^{-20} \\propto \\frac{x}{10^5}$ or $10^{-15}$m.  However, atomic nucleai are roughly $10^{-15}$ long.  In other words, if we had a solid rod from New York to Philadelphia, a gravitational wave would change its length by one or two nuclei (not atoms, **nuclei!**).  We probably don't need to explain that such a rod is impossible to build, and that thermal expansion, atomic vibrations, etc would completely defeat the purpose.\n\nWe observed that some strains were several orders of magnitude larger.  For example, this wave from the Virgo observatory:\n\n<img alt=\"LIGO with spike from Virgo\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/lgSZNPm.png\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 40%;\" />\n\nIt just dwarfs all others, so we scaled those events to make them comparable to the ones from Hanford and Livingstson.\n\n##### Step 6: Gaussian curve function\n- (image of unadjusted bell curve function)\n- description of lifting up the left side so only the right of the event was dampened\n- (image of adjusted bell curve function)\n\n##### Perspective effect\n- show code for\n- why did we abandon?","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00009-c468eb40-6f06-4095-8892-e50abbacf52e","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00002-39670ef9-438c-4e41-ada6-d09b7cb06c67","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Further Reading\n\n#### Waves \n[Wave Equation - hyperphysics](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Waves/waveq.html)\n[Electromagnetic Wave Equation - hyperphysics](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Waves/emwv.html)\n\n#### General Relativity - Intuition\n[General Relativity for Laypeople - a primer](https://www.markushanke.net/general-relativity-for-laypeople-a-first-primer/)\n[The Equivalence principle & the deflection of light](https://www.einstein-online.info/en/spotlight/equivalence_light/)\n[time dilation in GR](https://thecuriousastronomer.wordpress.com/2015/02/11/time-dilation-in-general-relativity/)\n[What is space - nautil.us](http://nautil.us/issue/49/the-absurd/what-is-space)\n\n#### General Relativity - full on!\n[A no nonsense introduction to General Relativity - Sean Caroll](https://www.astro.caltech.edu/~george/ay21/readings/grtiny.pdf)\n[Lecture notes on General Relativity - Sean Caroll](https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/grnotes/)\n[Introduction to general relativity - H.
