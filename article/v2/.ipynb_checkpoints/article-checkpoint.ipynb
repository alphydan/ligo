    "A full treatment would require laying a deep foundation which involves\n",
    "calculus, differential equations, algebra, tensors, modern mechanics and \n",

    "A common equation we learn in High School is $v = \\lambda \\times f$, \n",
    "where the velocity of the wave $v$ is equal to the wavelength $\\lambda$ times the frequency $f$.  \n",
    "This assumes the wave is monocromatic (only one wavelength, or only one frequency), and always\n",
    "travels at the same speed.  However, that equation says nothing about where the wave is, \n",
    "how high it is or in which direction it's moving.  For that we need differential equations.\n",
    "If you have learnt how to find a derivative (often written $f'$ or $\\frac{df}{dx}$) \n",
    "you can understand differential equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Differential Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "All Physical laws so far can be written down as equations which combine a variable \n",
    "(time, displacement, electric field, temperature, etc ) and one or more derivatives of that variable.\n",
    "Such an equation is called a _differential equation_.  For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F = -kx $$\n",
    "\n",
    "That equation describes the forces on a spring.  It says, \n",
    "the more you stretch the spring (so, $x$ gets bigger ),\n",
    "the bigger the force $F$ becomes (pointing in the opposite direction of the stretching).\n",
    "\n",
    "But, as Newton postulated, $F = ma$.  But, $a = \\frac{\\Delta v}{\\Delta t}$.  \n",
    "(reminder: $\\Delta x$ means, difference between final and initial x, \n",
    "that's why they are **differen**tial equations).\n",
    "When $\\Delta v$ is a tiny difference, we write $\\frac{dv}{dt}$.  Or said otherwise, \n",
    "the acceleration is the derivative of the velocity with respect to time.\n",
    "Now, to save some ink (pixels?) and make equations easier to read, physicists \n",
    "have a special notation.  **The dot notation**.  A dot above a variable means take a time derivative.\n",
    "So, $\\frac{dv}{dt} = \\dot{v}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So back to our differential equation.  The force from a spring is $F = -kx$.\n",
    "but $F = ma = m\\dot{v}$.  And in fact, $v = \\frac{dv}{dt}$.  Since the velocity\n",
    "is the derivative of the displacement, we can say: $a = \\dot{v} = \\ddot{x}$.\n",
    "Putting all this back into our spring equation we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\ddot{x} = -\\frac{k}{m} x $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In plain English: \n",
    "\n",
    "> Can you find a function $x(t)$ that when you take the \n",
    "derivative twice you get the same function but with a \n",
    "$-\\frac{k}{m}$ in front?\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of Physics can be cast to this process:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write down the force\n",
    "2. Put it into Newton's equation\n",
    "3. You will get a riddle about derivatives\n",
    "4. Solve the riddle $\\Rightarrow$ get the answer! \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's solve our riddle!  You could try $t^2$, $e^{t^3}$, $3t^k$, \n",
    "and see if it works.  However, if you are an expert at derivatives\n",
