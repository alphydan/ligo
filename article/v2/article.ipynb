When they pass through the Earth, \nthey shrink some distances and lengthen others.  Many words in that sentence \ncontain subtleties  (_affect_, _distance_, _shrink_), but let us keep it simple for now. \n\nA way to measure distance is to send light down a tunnel, \nreflect it on a mirror, and receive it back.  In the image above \nthere are two perpendicular tunnels.  Most of the time, light takes the same\ntime on either path.  However, when gravitational waves stretch one arm, light\narrives slightly later than on the other one. \n\nThe _shrinking_ and the delay, however, are minuscule. The tunnels are 4 km long (2.5 miles),\nso the return trip takes\n$t = \\frac{d}{c} \\approx \\frac{2 \\times 4 \\times 10^3}{3 \\times 10^8} \\approx 0.00003s $.  \n\nA rough estimate tells us that when the _short_ tunnel measures 4000m, the _long_ \nor _stretched_ tunnel measures 4000.000000000000000001m.  Or just slightly longer.\nWhere _slightly_ is probably the biggest understatement **ever**! \n\nAs you can imagine, a stopwatch won't tell the difference between 0.00003s \nand 0.0000299999999999999999. \n\nThe measurement is carried out by *interferometry*,\nthe process of purposefully superimposing (overlaying, or combining) \nwaves to determine information about them.\n\nIn the above image of LIGO's Hanford Interferometer, \nyou can see an aerial view of its ultra high vacuum tunnels.\nEach 'arm' of the L-shape experiment has a perfectly straight, single colour and coherent light beam.\n\nThe function of each arm in the overall interferometer is illustrated below.\n\n<img alt=\"Simplified operation of a gravitational wave observatory\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Gravitational_wave_observatory_principle.svg/800px-Gravitational_wave_observatory_principle.svg.png\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 20%\" />\n\nIn **Figure 1** of the diagram, a beamsplitter (green line) splits coherent light emitted from source (white box)\ninto two beams, which then reflect off the mirrors (cyan rectangles) at the end of each arm.\nThe reflected beams recombine (after approximately 280 round trips down the 4 km length).\nThis \"recombination\" results in constructive or destructive interference depending on the path\ndifference. An interference pattern is detected at the circle.\nIn **Figure 2**, a gravitational wave (yellow) passes over the left arm and so changes its length slightly, \nresulting in a measurably different interference pattern detected at the circle.\n\n\nTo summarize, LIGO aims to detect gravitational waves by **comparing the time of \npropagation of light in mutually orthogonal paths in the distorted \nspace between freely suspended test masses separated by 4 km using \nthe technique of laser interferometry.**\n","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00009-d54e3819-db91-4ca0-a09e-409d72c5a734","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Y-axis squiggles\nThe following plots show gravitational wave data from LIGO (the same data we used to make *Wave Divisions*).\n<img alt=\"LIGO gravitational wave plots\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8gGzjC-JhVs/VrrDRusclcI/AAAAAAAABzU/YraqMUN6zmY/s1600/Fig1_Split_v17_top3_standalone.png\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 50%\" />\nNote that the y-axis on these plots is called strain.\n**Strain** is amount of deformation experienced \nby a body in the direction of force applied, \ndivided by initial dimensions of the body.  Or:\n\n$$ \\mathrm{Strain} = \\frac{\\Delta L }{L} $$\n\nWith $L$ the initial length, and $\\Delta L$ the change in said length.  In our case, it's the relative change in one arm of the LIGO intereferometer compared to the other. \nThus, strain is unitless. \n\nTypical LIGO strains are in the range $10^{-19} - 20^{-23}$. \nThis means that if you had a $100$km metal rod ($10^5$m), you would need to measure differences \nin length which are $10^{-20}$.  In this example $L = 10^5$, so $\\Delta L \\propto 10^{-15}$m. \nHowever, atomic nucleai are roughly $10^{-15}$ long.  In other words, if we had a solid rod from New York to Philadelphia, a \ngravitational wave would change its length by one or two nuclei (not atoms, **nuclei!**).\nWe probably don't need to explain that such a rod is impossible to build, and that thermal expansion, \natomic vibrations, etc. would completely defeat the purpose.\nIt is for this reason LIGO doesn't measure distance directly, instead opting for laser \ninterferometry as\ndescribed above.","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00010-5130000b-9de7-4110-9806-acb3441fa63f","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Hanford, Livingston, and Virgo\nLIGO operates two gravitational wave observatories: one in Livingston, Louisiana \n(signified by **L1** in our code) and one in Hanford, in Washington (signified by **H1**). \nThese sites are 3,002 kilometers (1,865 miles) apart when measured straight through the earth, \nand just over this value when measured over the surface.
