When they pass through the Earth, \nthey shrink some distances and lengthen others.  Many words in that sentence \ncontain subtleties  (_affect_, _distance_, _shrink_), but let us keep it simple for now. \n\nA way to measure distance is to send light down a tunnel, \nreflect it on a mirror, and receive it back.  In the image above \nthere are two perpendicular tunnels.  Most of the time, light takes the same\ntime on either path.  However, when gravitational waves stretch one arm, light\narrives slightly later than on the other one. \n\nThe _shrinking_ and the delay, however, are minuscule. The tunnels are 4 km long (2.5 miles),\nso the return trip takes\n$t = \\frac{d}{c} \\approx \\frac{2 \\times 4 \\times 10^3}{3 \\times 10^8} \\approx 0.00003s $.  \n\nA rough estimate tells us that when the _short_ tunnel measures 4000m, the _long_ \nor _stretched_ tunnel measures 4000.000000000000000001m.  Or just slightly longer.\nWhere _slightly_ is probably the biggest understatement **ever**! \n\nAs you can imagine, a stopwatch won't tell the difference between 0.00003s \nand 0.0000299999999999999999. \n\nThe measurement is carried out by *interferometry*,\nthe process of purposefully superimposing (overlaying, or combining) \nwaves to determine information about them.\n\nIn the above image of LIGO's Hanford Interferometer, \nyou can see an aerial view of its ultra high vacuum tunnels.\nEach 'arm' of the L-shape experiment has a perfectly straight, single colour and coherent light beam.\n\nThe function of each arm in the overall interferometer is illustrated below.\n\n<img alt=\"Simplified operation of a gravitational wave observatory\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Gravitational_wave_observatory_principle.svg/800px-Gravitational_wave_observatory_principle.svg.png\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 20%\" />\n\nIn **Figure 1** of the diagram, a beamsplitter (green line) splits coherent light emitted from source (white box)\ninto two beams, which then reflect off the mirrors (cyan rectangles) at the end of each arm.\nThe reflected beams recombine (after approximately 280 round trips down the 4 km length).\nThis \"recombination\" results in constructive or destructive interference depending on the path\ndifference. An interference pattern is detected at the circle.\nIn **Figure 2**, a gravitational wave (yellow) passes over the left arm and so changes its length slightly, \nresulting in a measurably different interference pattern detected at the circle.\n\n\nTo summarize, LIGO aims to detect gravitational waves by **comparing the time of \npropagation of light in mutually orthogonal paths in the distorted \nspace between freely suspended test masses separated by 4 km using \nthe technique of laser interferometry.**\n","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00009-d54e3819-db91-4ca0-a09e-409d72c5a734","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Y-axis squiggles\nThe following are example plots of the gravitational waves data collected by LIGO (the same data we used to make *Wave Divisions*).\n<img alt=\"LIGO gravitational wave plots\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8gGzjC-JhVs/VrrDRusclcI/AAAAAAAABzU/YraqMUN6zmY/s1600/Fig1_Split_v17_top3_standalone.png\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 50%\" />\nNote that the y-axis on these plots is called strain.\n**Strain** is amount of deformation experienced \nby a body in the direction of force applied, \ndivided by initial dimensions of the body.  Or:\n\n$$ \\mathrm{Strain} = \\frac{\\Delta L }{L} $$\n\nWith $L$ the initial length, and $\\Delta L$ the change in said length.  In our case, it's the relative change in one arm of the LIGO intereferometer compared to the other. \nThus, strain is unitless. \n\nTypical LIGO strains are in the range $10^{-19} - 20^{-23}$. \nThis means that if you had a $100$km metal rod ($10^5$m), you would need to measure differences \nin length which are $10^{-20}$.  In this example $L = 10^5$, so $\\Delta L \\propto 10^{-15}$m. \nHowever, atomic nucleai are roughly $10^{-15}$ long.  In other words, if we had a solid rod from New York to Philadelphia, a \ngravitational wave would change its length by one or two nuclei (not atoms, **nuclei!**).\nWe probably don't need to explain that such a rod is impossible to build, and that thermal expansion, \natomic vibrations, etc. would completely defeat the purpose.\nIt is for this reason LIGO doesn't measure distance directly, instead opting for laser \ninterferometry as\ndescribed above.","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00010-5130000b-9de7-4110-9806-acb3441fa63f","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Hanford, Livingston, and Virgo\nLIGO operates two gravitational wave observatories: one in Livingston, Louisiana \n(signified by **L1** in our code) and one in Hanford, in Washington (signified by **H1**). \nThese sites are 3,002 kilometers (1,865 miles) apart when measured straight through the earth, \nand just over this value when measured over the surface.

Instead we will try to use math and concepts \navailable to a curious and motivated high school student. \n\nThe most difficult concept to grasp is what these waves are _made of_.\nOr the related question, if water goes up & down in a water wave, \nwhat goes up and down in a gravitational wave? Before we get there,\nwe will quickly review some math & notation about waves in general.\n\n### The wave equation\n\n<img alt=\"simple wave definitions\" src=\"./img/wave_nomenclature.png\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 45%;\" />\n\n\nA common equation we learn in high school is $v = \\lambda \\times f$, \nwhere the velocity of the wave $v$ is equal to the wavelength $\\lambda$ times the frequency $f$.  \nThis assumes the wave is monocromatic (only one wavelength, or only one frequency), and always\ntravels at the same speed.  However, that equation says nothing about where the wave is, \nhow high it is or in which direction it's moving.  For that we need differential equations.\nIf you have learnt how to find a derivative (often written $f'$ or $\\frac{df}{dx}$) \nyou can understand differential equations.\n\n#### Differential Equations\n\n\nAll Physical laws so far can be written down as equations which combine a variable \n(time, displacement, electric field, temperature, etc ) and one or more derivatives of that variable.\nSuch an equation is called a _differential equation_.  For example:\n\n$$ F = -kx $$\n\nThat equation describes the force on a spring.  It says, \nthe more you stretch the spring (so, $x$ gets bigger ),\nthe bigger the force $F$ becomes (pointing in the opposite direction of the stretching).\n\nBut, as Newton postulated, $F = ma$.  But, $a = \\frac{\\Delta v}{\\Delta t}$.  \n(reminder: $\\Delta x$ means, difference between final and initial x, \nthat's why they are **differen**tial equations).\nWhen $\\Delta v$ is a tiny difference, we write $\\frac{dv}{dt}$.  Or said otherwise, \nthe acceleration is the derivative of the velocity with respect to time.\nNow, to save some ink (pixels?) and make equations easier to read, physicists \nhave a special notation.  **The dot notation**.  A dot above a variable means take a time derivative.\nSo, $\\frac{dv}{dt} = \\dot{v}$.\n\nSo back to our differential equation.  The force from a spring is $F = -kx$.\nbut $F = ma = m\\dot{v}$.  And in fact, $v = \\frac{dx}{dt}$.  Since the velocity\nis the derivative of the displacement, we can say: $a = \\dot{v} = \\ddot{x}$.\nPutting all this back into our spring equation we have:\n\n$$ \\ddot{x} = -\\frac{k}{m} x $$\n\nIn plain English: \n\n> Can you find a function $x(t)$ that when you take the \nderivative twice you get the same function but with a \n$-\\frac{k}{m}$ in front?\n\nMost of Physics can be cast to this process:  \n\n1. Write down the force\n2. Put it into Newton's equation\n3. You will get a riddle about derivatives\n4. Solve the riddle $\\Rightarrow$ get the answer! \n\n\nLet's solve our riddle!  You could try $t^2$, $e^{t^3}$, $3t^k$, \nand see if it works.  However, if you are an expert at derivatives\nyou know a function which comes back to itself with a minus after two derivatives:\n$$cos(t) \\rightarrow -sin(t) \\rightarrow -cos(t)$$\n\nWith an extra trick, we can make it work:\n\n$$cos( \\omega t) \\rightarrow -\\omega sin(\\omega t) \\rightarrow -\\omega^2 cos(\\omega t)$$\n\nwhere we write $\\omega$ instead of the cumbersome $\\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$.\n\nNow we know that a mass at the end of a spring (without friction) will move a distance\naway from equilibrium $x(t) = cos(\\omega t)$, tracing the shape of a cosine function.

In 1908 Minkowski announced to fellow mathematicians:\n<blockquote>[...] space by itself, and time by itself, \nare doomed to fade away into mere shadows, \nand only a kind of union of the two will preserve an independent reality.\n</blockquote>\n\nThe metric above, in fact, is not just for distances between locations.\nIt finds the distance between **events**. \n\nThe word **event** in Physics has a very specific meaning; it means a point in spacetime.\nAn event has 4 coordinates. Let's write it as $(t, x, y, z)$.\nIf you are standing in your chair at location (2,0,0) \nat time $t=0$, that is event $(0,2,0,0)$.  \nEven if you don't move, time goes by... \nand a second later, you have \ntravelled one second into the future.  \nYour new coordinates are $(1,2,0,0 )$.\nIn the next second you travel 1m in the $x$-direction and land at $(2,3,0,0)$:\n3 meters away from $x=0$, and 2 seconds away from $t=0$.\n\nHow much did you travel in spacetime?  Minkowski says:\n\n$$s = \\sqrt{(2c)^2 - 1^2}$$\n\nYou can imagine this as a very, very, very thin pizza slice.  In the time direction\nwe travelled 2$\\times$ 300,000km and in the x-direction we travelled $1$m.\nOnly light can create non-thin pizzas.  In a second, it can move 300,000km \nin the time direction and 300,000km in the $x$-direction, making a nice isosceles triangle.\n\n#### Notation for metrics:\n\nOkay, before we move to General relativity we are going to change our notation for metrics.\nPythagoras for a tiny tiny distance $ds$ can be re-written as:\n\n$$ ds^2 = dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2  $$\n\n$$ \n= \\left(\\begin{matrix} dx & dy & dz  \\end{matrix} \\right)\n\\left(\\begin{matrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\  0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1  \\end{matrix} \\right)\n\\left(\\begin{matrix} dx \\\\ dy \\\\ dz  \\end{matrix} \\right)\n$$\n\nThis may seem pretty useless, but this helps us see more clearly the \nfactors in front of the $dx, dy, dz$. The matrix in the middle is what we are interested in.\nIn flat spacetime, this becomes\n\n$$ \nds^2 = \\left(\\begin{matrix} dt & dx & dy & dz  \\end{matrix} \\right)\n\\left(\\begin{matrix} c^2 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\  0 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & -1  \\end{matrix} \\right)\n\\left(\\begin{matrix} dt \\\\ dx \\\\ dy \\\\ dz  \\end{matrix} \\right)\n$$\n\nTo make our life easier we take c=1 (speed of light = 1).  \nTo do this all we have to do is make up some new units. I hearby invent the Mitur!\n1 Mitur = 300,000,000 meters.  So c = 1 Mitur/s.  From now on, we'll use Miturs as our units.\n\nNext, we'll use the same symbols for all coordinates.  So instead of writing\n$(cdt, dx, dy, dz)$ we will use $(x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3)$.   \nTo save pixels and typing, we shorten it like so:\n\n$$ x^\\alpha = (x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3)$$\nwhere $\\alpha$ is assumed to run from $0 \\rightarrow 3$. The vector can be transposed like so:\n\n$$ x_\\alpha = \\left( \\begin{matrix} x_0\\\\ x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3  \\end{matrix} \\right)$$\n\nAt last, we can define the metric in General Relativity.  \nMeasuring tiny displacements in spacetime is done like so:\n\n$$ \nds^2 = dx^\\alpha \\left(\\begin{matrix} g_{00} & g_{01} & g_{02} & g_{03} \\\\  \ng_{10} & g_{11} & g_{12} & g_{13} \\\\ \ng_{20} & g_{21} & g_{22} & g_{23} \\\\ \ng_{30} & g_{31} & g_{32} & g_{33} \\end{matrix} \\right)\ndx_\\alpha\n$$\n\nThe matrix in the middle is called **the metric** and tells us how to measure spacetime.\nIt is usually shortened as $$g_{\\mu\\nu}$$. Surprisingly, \nno matter which coordinates you chose, $ds^2$ is always the same number in\nrelativity.
